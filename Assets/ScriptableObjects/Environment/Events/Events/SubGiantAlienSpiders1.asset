  _eventDescription: Your crew boards the station, cautiously moving between corridors.
    Suddenly a man-sized arachnid bursts from a vent in the ceiling, followed by
    countless more. You fight your way back to the airlock and are forced to leave
    before accounting for all crew members. Not everybody made it back.
